1-7 Clutches frantically at wound before expiring
8-15 Collapses without a sound
16-23 Staggers about before expiring
24-31 Corpse flung aside
32-38 Expires screaming in agony
38-45 Seems okay for a moment, then expires in flood of gore
46-52 Dies making horrible gurgling sounds
53-58 Twitching, mangled mess
59-65 Weapon buried in body
66-71 Dies graphically, getting opponent tangled in body
72-79 Attacker is showered in gore
80-85 Blood and gore everywhere
86-93 Parts detached from body
93-98 The remnants are barely recognizable
99-100 So unspeakable that onlookers must roll for M ental T rauma
